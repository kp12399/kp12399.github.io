      <h2>Personal Life</h2>




      <p>I was born in <strong>Richmond Hill</strong>, Ontario, at the Mackenzie Health Hospital and have lived in Richmond Hill for my whole life. My father was from London, England and moved to North America when he was 16, and my mother was born in Ethiopia and moved here when she was 6. In elementary school I was very interested in visual arts and drawing, and it was my main passion throughout school until around grade 8, when I lost the passion to do art in terms of physical drawings with a pencil. In highschool I picked up more technological art skills, meaning I was able to continue my skills in art with a computer, through graphic design and interface design. It was during high school that I realized I wanted to go into a technology/design field due to the fact I was interested in the design aspects as well as the technology and computer science aspect.

        <h2>Professional Life</h2>

        <p>I am attending <a href="https://www.georgebrown.ca/programs/interaction-design-and-development-program-g103/">Interaction Design and Development at George Brown College</a>, and I am hoping it leads to some sort of user interface designer career path. Through some school factors as well as a portfolio of my existing interfaces that I have designed, I believe I can land an internship in Downtown,Toronto within the next few years. Through a few internships I am confident that the experience in working in the real world will help bring me to a full time UI designer job and allow me to pursue my passion of designing user interfaces and making sure clients have well made websites and applications.</p>
